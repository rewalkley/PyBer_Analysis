# PyBer Findings

## Overview of the anlaysis

V. Isualize has asked Omar and I to create a summary graph to analyze the ride sharing data by city type, to give us the weekly fares for each.

## Results

The results of the analysis were about as one would expect - much higher in urban city types vs suburban and rural types. Another observation is the correlation in fare amounts across the city types. For example, all three city types spike upwards in total weekly fares in the 3rd week of February.

By looking at the summary DataFrame, one can also see the average fare per driver and ride are higher in rural areas than suburban and urban areas. This is likely due to fewer fares, and probably longer rides.

One interesting item to note is the ratio of total rides to total drivers: the rides-to-drivers ratio is less than 1 in urban cities, whereas the ratio is 1.6 in rural cities.  

## Summary

In summary, based on the findings of my analysis, I have 3 recommendations for the CEO:
* It would be helpful to know why weekly fares in all three city types spiked upward in late February. Was there a fare promotion? Or event? If that could be copied, then it may help boost ridership further
* Understand why the average fare per ride is lower in urban areas vs rural/suburban areas. Is this due to shorter rides? 
* In urban cities, maybe incentivize longer rides to combat the issue of having such low average fares per ride/driver.
